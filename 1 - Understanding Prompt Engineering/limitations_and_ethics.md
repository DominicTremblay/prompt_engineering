# Challenges, Limitation, and Ethical Implications

Description: Discuss the challenges and limitations of prompt engineering, such as prompt ambiguity, model biases, unpredictability in outputs, and the need for iterative refinement. Explain how these challenges can be mitigated.
Ethical Considerations:

Description: Address the ethical implications of prompt engineering, including the potential for generating harmful or biased content, the responsibility of the prompt engineer, and considerations for transparency and fairness.
Best Practices in Prompt Engineering:

- ambiguity and vagueness in prompts =>  prompt engineers must strive to craft prompts that are as clear and specific as possible

## Model Hallucination

- The model tries its best to accomodate the task, but it might generate false information

Causes:

- Limited training data

Example:

Create a prompt about a ficticious company with a ficticious product



- Ensuring precision and relevance in generated content
