# Personas

One of the key benefits of using a persona pattern is maintaining consistency in responses. Adhering to a defined persona makes the AI's replies more predictable and aligned with the user's expectations.                

When you use the persona pattern in reverse, it is commonly referred to as the Audience Persona Pattern in the context of prompt engineering. The "audience persona pattern" refers to a predefined profile or representation of the intended audience for a particular application or use case. It helps in tailoring the responses generated by LLMs to suit better the needs and expectations of a specific group of users or individuals.

ex.: “Assume that I am an adult who graduated from college with a degree in communications. I have no experience with computer science. How would you explain that method to me?”

  + additional context
  + Personas help the model give more accurate outputs
  + Personas make LLMs more intuitive for humans to use
  + Consider giving personas a unique tone, style, and voice
  + General rule: always provide a persona relevant to your task
  + Personas are both fun and functional
