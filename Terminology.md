### **GLOSSARY: Key Terms in Prompt Engineering**

1. **Prompt**:
   - **Definition**: A set of instructions or input provided to an AI model to elicit a specific response or output. In prompt engineering, the design of these prompts is critical to achieving the desired results from the model.

2. **Context**:
   - **Definition**: The background information or setting provided in a prompt that helps the AI model understand the situation or task at hand. Effective use of context can improve the relevance and accuracy of the AI’s response.

3. **Token**:
   - **Definition**: A unit of text, such as a word or a character, that the AI model processes. Most AI models have limits on the number of tokens they can handle in a single prompt, making token management an important aspect of prompt engineering.

4. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - **Definition**: The practice of designing and refining prompts to guide AI models in generating specific and desired outputs. This involves understanding how different prompt elements influence the model’s behavior.

5. **Output**:
   - **Definition**: The response generated by an AI model after processing a prompt. The quality of the output depends on how well the prompt is designed.

6. **Optimization**:
   - **Definition**: The process of refining a prompt to improve the quality, relevance, and efficiency of the AI model’s response. Optimization may involve adjusting the prompt’s wording, structure, or context.

7. **Temperature**:
   - **Definition**: A parameter used in some AI models to control the randomness of the output. Lower temperatures result in more deterministic outputs, while higher temperatures produce more varied responses. This is an important setting in prompt engineering.

8. **Few-Shot Learning**:
   - **Definition**: A technique where a model is given a few examples within the prompt to guide its response. In prompt engineering, few-shot prompts are used to teach the model how to respond to similar tasks.

9. **Zero-Shot Learning**:
   - **Definition**: A method where the AI model generates a response without being provided with examples within the prompt. This requires the model to infer the task from the prompt’s description alone.

10. **Completion**:
    - **Definition**: The text generated by an AI model in response to a prompt. The completion can be influenced by the prompt’s structure and content.

11. **Prompt Injection**:
    - **Definition**: A technique used to insert specific instructions or content into a prompt to guide the AI model toward a particular type of response. This can include adding context, examples, or constraints.

12. **Bias in Prompting**:
    - **Definition**: The unintended influence that a prompt might have on the AI model’s response, often leading to skewed or unbalanced outputs. Understanding and mitigating bias is an important aspect of prompt engineering.

13. **Stop Sequence**:
    - **Definition**: A sequence of tokens that tells the AI model when to stop generating further text. Proper use of stop sequences can prevent the model from producing irrelevant or excessive output.

14. **Prompt Template**:
    - **Definition**: A predefined format or structure for prompts that can be reused across different tasks or models. Prompt templates help ensure consistency and efficiency in prompt engineering.

15. **Prompt Tuning**:
    - **Definition**: The process of adjusting and refining prompts based on feedback from the AI model’s outputs. This iterative process helps in enhancing the effectiveness of prompts over time.

16. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
    - **Definition**: A field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. Prompt engineering is a key technique within NLP to guide AI models in understanding and generating human-like text.

17. **Instruction Prompting**:
    - **Definition**: A type of prompting where the AI model is given explicit instructions on how to perform a task. This is used to ensure that the model follows a specific process or format in its response.

18. **Multi-turn Prompting**:
    - **Definition**: The process of using a series of prompts to conduct a dialogue with an AI model. Each prompt builds on the previous responses to achieve a more complex or detailed outcome.

19. **Ambiguity in Prompting**:
    - **Definition**: When a prompt is unclear or open to multiple interpretations, leading to unpredictable or varied outputs from the AI model. Reducing ambiguity is crucial for effective prompt engineering.

20. **Latent Space**:
    - **Definition**: The abstract space in which AI models represent and process inputs like prompts. Understanding how prompts are mapped to latent space can help in designing more effective prompts.
